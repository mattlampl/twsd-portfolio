### Final Project Writeup
To create this story, I followed a process where I was able to iteratively develop the story and visualizations, then tweak them based on user feedback. In [Part 1](notion://www.notion.so/mattlampl/final-part-1.md), I created an outline that was based on a story arc. I decided to sketch out a visual representation of how the audience should feel when presented with a certain part of the story. From there, I decided what visualizations I would have to show in order to tell the story, then mapped them to the story arc. The story arc method really helped me in deciding which visualizations were necessary and what emotions they should evoke. Once I knew which visualizations I was going to include, I began with the rough sketches. I hand drew these and tried to create what I thought the final visualizations might look like. For the maps, I designed them in Carto, a simple, web-based GIS tool, that allowed me to quickly create and tweak what the maps looked like. I found this easier than attempting to draw the maps out by hand. Once the rough drafts were drawn, I made a story outline and placed the graphics in the correct spots in the outline. This proved to be extremely helpful for crafting the final version. Parallel to sketching the graphs, I went and found the data necessary to make them. The data used is all publicly available data from the city, or federal agencies.

Next, I began working on a wireframed version of the story in [Part 2](final-part-2.md).
