### Final Project Writeup
To create this story, I followed a process where I was able to iteratively develop the story and visualizations, then tweak them based on user feedback. In [Part 1](/final-part-1.md), I created an outline that was based on a story arc. I decided to sketch out a visual representation of how the audience should feel when presented with a certain part of the story. From there, I decided what visualizations I would have to show in order to tell the story, then mapped them to the story arc. The story arc method really helped me in deciding which visualizations were necessary and what emotions they should evoke. Once I knew which visualizations I was going to include, I began with the rough sketches. I hand drew these and tried to create what I thought the final visualizations might look like. For the maps, I designed them in Carto, a simple, web-based GIS tool, that allowed me to quickly create and tweak what the maps looked like. I found this easier than attempting to draw the maps out by hand. Once the rough drafts were drawn, I made a story outline and placed the graphics in the correct spots in the outline. This proved to be extremely helpful for crafting the final version. Parallel to sketching the graphs, I went and found the data necessary to make them. The data used is all publicly available data from the city, or federal agencies.

Next, I began working on a wireframed version of the story in [Part 2](final-part-2.md). To start, I made a moodboard using photos of community gardens and urban farms. I wanted my story to have a cohesive feeling. I used the colors of the pictures in the mood board to create a color palette that I thought would adequately convey the feeling of eating fresh fruits and vegetables. Next, I began the process of converting my hand drawn graphs into digital ones that could be embedded into shorthand. I started out using Tableau because I thought this would give me the most control over the look and feel of the visualizations. It wasn’t until I tried embedding the graphs, however, that I found that it didn’t look how I wanted it to once it was up on shorthand. I then recreated the graphs in a web-based data visualization platform called datawrapper. I found that this allowed me to create the minimalist visualizations that I was going for. As a bonus, datawrapper also has some basic mapping capabilities. I was able to recreate the maps I made from Part 1 that matched the style of the graphs. For the wireframe, I kept the placeholder text that shorthand pre-populates into the text boxes, and placed the graphs where I thought they should go. I then showed this to a handful of peers and conducted an interview to gather user feedback. This feedback was extremely helpful in crafting the final version.

Finally, in Part III, I combined all of the user feedback and tweaks that I generated in the first two parts and rounded out my story. Most of the people found that the graph comparing the counties was confusing. I amended this in a few different ways. First, I chose only counties that contained a major city. Then, I changed the label to include that city’s name instead of the county name. I grappled with this second part because the data includes more than just that city, but I wanted to make it easier for the viewer to know what was being represented. For example, most people know of Chicago, but may not know that it sits in Cook County. 

The next thing that I changed was the overall look and feel of the visualizations. I wanted the maps to have a cohesive look. One way that I attempted this was adding a color legend to the titles of the maps. This was also an attempt to explain what the colored dots on the map meant. There was one interviewee that was confused that the dots represented grocery stores. The idea with the colored title was to replace the need for a legend while still explaining the symbology.
