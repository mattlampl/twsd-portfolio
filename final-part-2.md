The first step in creating my storyboard was creating a moodboard using Canva. This helped me to visualize what I wanted my final presentation to look like. I found a few good images of grocery stores, and fresh produce that I wanted to use. These images are meant to evoke an emotion that I intend to convey to my audience through my story. I also like the similarity of colors in the images. I picked out a few that I thought might work well on the charts and maps.
