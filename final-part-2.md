# Moodboard

The first step in creating my storyboard was creating a moodboard using Canva. This helped me to visualize what I wanted my final presentation to look like. I found a few good images of grocery stores, and fresh produce that I wanted to use. These images are meant to evoke an emotion that I intend to convey to my audience through my story. I also like the similarity of colors in the images. I picked out a few that I thought might work well on the charts and maps.

# Wireframe
[See the wireframe preview on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/tqDIQ4mRXE4CqFao)

I decided to use Shorthand to create my wireframe. It was easy to play around with the layout of each section. I left the placeholder text in the text boxes, but did change the text of each heading. I also found that embedding tableau and carto visualizations did not go as planned on shorthand. I remade all of these visualizations in datawrapper. I really like the way they turned out. They are all quite nice and simplified and I think they will work well with the final story.

# User Research
I will be conducting user interviews using the following interview questions:

- *What did you like about this storyboard?*
- *Is there anything that you did not like?*
- *Is there anything that you wish were explained more or had more details?*
- *What is one thing that you learned?*
- *Is there anything that suprised you?*
- *Do you have any suggestions on what might make this better?*
