# Final Project, Part II

# Moodboard
![Moodboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13319538/193477646-ac580e73-b67b-4a0e-9ba8-bce422c16c0a.png)

The first step in creating my storyboard was creating a moodboard using Canva. This helped me to visualize what I wanted my final presentation to look like. I found a few good images of grocery stores, and fresh produce that I wanted to use. These images are meant to evoke an emotion that I intend to convey to my audience through my story. I also like the similarity of colors in the images. I picked out a few that I thought might work well on the charts and maps.

# Wireframe
[See the wireframe preview on Shorthand](https://preview.shorthand.com/tqDIQ4mRXE4CqFao)

I decided to use Shorthand to create my wireframe. It was easy to play around with the layout of each section. I left the placeholder text in the text boxes, but did change the text of each heading. I also found that embedding tableau and carto visualizations did not go as planned on shorthand. I remade all of these visualizations in datawrapper. I really like the way they turned out. They are all quite nice and simplified and I think they will work well with the final story.

# User Research
I will be conducting user interviews using the following interview questions:

- *What did you like about this storyboard?*
- *Is there anything that you did not like?*
- *Is there anything that you wish were explained more or had more details?*
- *What is one thing that you learned?*
- *Is there anything that suprised you?*
- *Do you have any suggestions on what might make this better?*

### Interview #2: Female, Late 20s

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What did you like about this wireframed story? | This is beautiful! I love the images of the fresh food, as well as the blue color behind the map. The story coheres as an aesthetic unit. Lovely. |
| Is there anything that you did not like? | I wish there were some interactivity with the map and the charts. Since this is an online medium, I guess I expected I’d be able to hover over certain parts of the project for more info. |
| What did you like about this storyboard? | Again, the aesthetics of this project are awesome. The narrative flow makes sense: start with a national profile, zoom into PA, then zoom into Pittsburgh and local-level disparities. The framing and scoping of this makes good sense. |
| Is there anything that you wish were explained more or had more details? | Guessing this will be answered in the text of the story, but I’m curious why the number of urban farms/community gardens doubled in the span of 5 years. Was this a covid-related response to food insecurity, i.e., it’s part of a larger national trend? See also the commentary below on what access means with regard to access to personal use vehicles. Also curious about grocery stores in Pittsburgh over time – have they followed the national trends, too? |
| What is one thing that you learned? | I really like the map showing where the grocery stores are. This makes it really clear that certain neighborhoods have strong access to fresh, healthy food, while others (most, really) have low access. I wonder if this will be tied into tract-level access to cars: a neighborhood could not have a grocery store, but if households have high personal vehicle access, then seeming distance is compressed. |
| Do you have any suggestions on what might make this better? |  If the storymaker wants to incorporate commentary on differential access across groups (e.g., racial or ethnic groups),  then having some type of overlay could help highlight that story. The y-axis for the “Grocery Stores per Capita in every PA County” chart is hard to read – maybe select ~5-10 counties that represent high, medium, and low counts to convey that Pittsburgh is pretty middling, grocery-store wise. Another idea here would be to compare Allegheny County with other “Rust Belt” counties across the country, like Cook County and the county where Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis, etc. are located. |
