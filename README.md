# About Me
Hello! My name is Matt Lampl. I am currently a second-year MSPPM-DA (Public Policy and Data Analytics) student at the Heinz College at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. When I am not looking at or making cool charts, you can find me running and biking around Pittsburgh.

Before coming to CMU, I completed my undergraduate degree in Information Sciences and Technology at Penn State. I then went on to work as a technology consultant in Chicago. Wanting to merge my technical skills with public policy, I decided to enroll in this program. In the summer of 2022, I interned with the City of Pittsburgh in it's Sustainability and Resiliance Division as a Food Policy Intern. I looked at the drivers of food insecurity in certain neighborhoods in the city as well as provided recommendations to improve food access in those areas.

# What I Hope to Learn
I love looking at charts. I believe this is the most effective way to communicate complicated data with an audience. I am hoping to learn how to make compelling, yet simple graphics in order to display important data. I am hoping to learn some fundamental design principles as well as how to create infographics, dashboards, and graphics in various software tools like Tableau and Shortform. Upon completion of my Masters degree, I am hoping to work as a data scientist in some policy context. Ideally, I will be able to create effective visuals that can aid in policy decision-making.
