# Step 1
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just learned that President Biden’s first year in office was the strongest year for economic growth since 1984. <a href="https://t.co/I3qpODiHqy">pic.twitter.com/I3qpODiHqy</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1486709480351952901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I found this tweet from the official White House page. At first glance, it looks like a standard bar chart. Upon closer inspection however, there has been some manipulation on the y-axis to make the final bar look taller than it really should be. There was some discourse in the comments about this, eventually leading to a revised tweet with a fixed y-axis.

# Step 2: Critique the Visualization
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/11192497"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

#### Engagement - 7
The fact that there was manipulation in this chart actually led to further engagement than normal with this type of graphic. There was rich discussion and heated debates surrounding this graph when it was published.

#### Aesthetics - 4
In my opinion, the background adds some visual clutter. I also am not fond of the unfamiliar typeface that was chosen for this chart. Additionally, I feel that the colors of the bars should be flipped (grays for the supporting bars, yellow for the last bar).

#### Intuitiveness - 8
This graph uses a common visual language, allowing for easy interpretation. I find it to be quite intuitive and understandable.

#### Truthfulness - 3
The y-axis manipulation of in the chart presents a huge red flag as to the trustworthyness of the data. Even if the data is accurate, the visual manipulation presents it in such a way that is untruthful.

#### Perceptibility - 8
This visualization does a great job at conveying the necessary information with minimal effort to the reader. The highlight quickly draws the attention to the final bar and the callout lets the reader know what they should be taking away.

#### Completeness - 6

The graphic has everything necessary to make it understandable. I knocked off a few points in this category because of the manipulation of the y-axis. This makes the chart less understandable due to the fact that not everyone would have caught that if it were not pointed out explicitly.

#### Usefulness - 7
The chart is useful for its intended audience. It aims to tell a specific story: *President Biden was able to raise the GDP 5.7% in his first year in office*. The chart does a good job of displaying that information.

### Overall Observations
What immediately stands out with this visualization is the highlighted bar at the far right of the graphic. It is the change in GDP for 2021. On first look, it looks like since Biden took office, there has been a drastic positive jump in GDP. Upon closer examination, however, the y-axis has been manipulated to include an extra tick mark (5.0, 5.5, 6.0). Even though this may be *technically* correct, it is a less-than-honest way to portray this data. Aesthetically, there could be some changes to this graph. In my opinion the background graphic is distracting and adds visual clutter. Also the color scheme of the white bar being the highlighted bar has almost the opposite effect. It is harder to see than the rest of the yellow bars.

### Primary Audience
The primary audience for this visualization is politically engaged people, as well as supporters of President Biden. Due to the fact that it was originally posted to the White House’s official Twitter account, it was effective at engaging the audience. Unfortunately for the President’s social media team, the Twitter followers immediately caught on to their ruse and forced them to tweet an updated version of the chart with a fixed y-axis. Aside from that, I do think that the visualization does a good job at getting across the necessary information. It is easy to decipher what the graphic is depicting at a quick glance and the message comes across quickly.

### Final Thoughts on this Visualization
This visualization is not egregiously bad. There are, however, some things that could be changed to enhance the message. Firstly, I would update the y-axis to make them uniform as to not try to dupe the audience. Secondly, I would update the coloring of the graphic. Namely, I would get rid of the background, then grey out the bars, and color the rightmost bar with an eye catching color.

### Thoughts About the Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile vs. The Good Charts Method
The Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile is an interesting tool for critique. It forces the critic to really study the graphic in each of its seven categories. The Good Charts method is great for getting that initial reaction to the visualization. It focuses more on what the reader initially sees and attempts to refine that aspect of the chart. I prefer the Good Charts method for that reason. Given that most people only glance at charts, it is extremely important to hone in on what you want the audience to see first.

# Step 4: Testing the Solution

To test the solution I came up with, I asked two people their thoughts using the questions below. I tested all three sketches and asked them at the end which one was the clearest.

### *Adult, Mid 20s*

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| What do you think this is? | These are graphs of the GDP between Trump and Biden. |
| What do you think it is telling you? | That the GDP has grown more under Biden than it did under Trump. |
| Is there anything you find surprising or confusing? | I am confused why the charts only date back to the early 2000s. |
| Who do you think is the intended audience for this? | Politically involved people and economists |
| Is there anything you would change or do differently? | Make the dates go back further so people can see the whole trend over time. |
| Which of these graphs do you find to be the most clear? | I think the third one is a little busy but displays the most information. |

### *Adult, Late 60s*
