# Step 1
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We just learned that President Biden’s first year in office was the strongest year for economic growth since 1984. <a href="https://t.co/I3qpODiHqy">pic.twitter.com/I3qpODiHqy</a></p>&mdash; The White House (@WhiteHouse) <a href="https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1486709480351952901?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I found this tweet from the official White House page. At first glance, it looks like a standard bar chart. Upon closer inspection however, there has been some manipulation on the y-axis to make the final bar look taller than it really should be. There was some discourse in the comments about this, eventually leading to a revised tweet with a fixed y-axis.

# Step 2: Critique the Visualization

### Overall Observations
What immediately stands out with this visualization is the highlighted bar at the far right of the graphic. It is the change in GDP for 2021. On first look, it looks like since Biden took office, there has been a drastic positive jump in GDP. Upon closer examination, however, the y-axis has been manipulated to include an extra tick mark (5.0, 5.5, 6.0). Even though this may be *technically* correct, it is a less-than-honest way to portray this data. Aesthetically, there could be some changes to this graph. In my opinion the background graphic is distracting and adds visual clutter. Also the color scheme of the white bar being the highlighted bar has almost the opposite effect. It is harder to see than the rest of the yellow bars.

### Primary Audience
The primary audience for this visualization is politically engaged people, as well as supporters of President Biden. Due to the fact that it was originally posted to the White House’s official Twitter account, it was effective at engaging the audience. Unfortunately for the President’s social media team, the Twitter followers immediately caught on to their ruse and forced them to tweet an updated version of the chart with a fixed y-axis. Aside from that, I do think that the visualization does a good job at getting across the necessary information. It is easy to decipher what the graphic is depicting at a quick glance and the message comes across quickly.

### Final Thoughts
This visualization is not egregiously bad. There are, however, some things that could be changed to enhance the message. Firstly, I would update the y-axis to make them uniform as to not try to dupe the audience. Secondly, I would update the coloring of the graphic. Namely, I would get rid of the background, then grey out the bars, and color the rightmost bar with an eye catching color.
